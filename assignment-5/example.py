# Example.py - Lesson 5: Loops - While Loops
# This file demonstrates repetition in programming using while loops

"""
While Loops in Python

While loops allow us to repeat code as long as a condition is true.
They are essential for creating programs that can handle repetitive tasks
and continue running until a specific goal is achieved.
