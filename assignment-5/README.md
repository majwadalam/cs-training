# Assignment 5: Loops - While Loops

## Learning Objectives
- Understand repetition in programming
- Learn while loop syntax and logic
- Recognize and avoid infinite loops
- Use loops for input validation

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to loops and why they're useful
- While loop syntax and execution
- Loop conditions and termination
- Infinite loops and how to avoid them
- Using while loops for input validation
- Break and continue statements

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about while loops and repetition. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 4:** Build a number guessing game where the computer picks a random number and the user has to guess it, with hints after each guess.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how while loops work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - A while loop that continues until the user guesses correctly
   - Random number generation using the `random` module
   - User input validation within the loop
   - Hints (higher/lower) after each incorrect guess
   - A counter to track the number of attempts
   - Break and/or continue statements where appropriate
   - Clear output and game instructions
   - Comments explaining your loop logic

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **While Loop Syntax**: `while condition:`
- **Loop Conditions**: Boolean expressions that control the loop
- **Loop Termination**: Making sure loops eventually end
- **Infinite Loop Prevention**: Ensuring the condition can become false
- **Break Statement**: Exit the loop immediately
- **Continue Statement**: Skip to the next iteration
- **Input Validation**: Using loops to get valid input
- **Random Module**: Generating random numbers

## Game Requirements
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Ask the user to guess the number
- Provide "higher" or "lower" hints after each guess
- Count the number of attempts
- Congratulate the user when they guess correctly
- Ask if they want to play again

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Follow the game prompts and try to guess the number

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different scenarios
- Make sure your loop eventually terminates
- Check for infinite loop conditions

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and creates a working number guessing game with proper loop logic and user feedback.
