# Assignment 3: Getting User Input

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to get input from users
- Convert between data types (type casting)
- Create interactive programs
- Handle basic input validation

## Topics Covered
- The input() function
- Type conversion: int(), float(), str()
- Creating interactive programs
- Common input errors and how to avoid them

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about getting user input and type conversion. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 2:** Build an interactive "About Me" questionnaire that collects user information and displays a formatted summary.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how the input() function and type conversion work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - Multiple input() statements to collect user information
   - Type conversion using int(), float(), str()
   - Interactive prompts with clear instructions
   - A formatted summary displaying all collected information
   - Error handling for invalid inputs (basic)
   - Comments explaining your code

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **input() Function**: Getting text input from users
- **Type Conversion**:
  - `int()` - Convert to integer
  - `float()` - Convert to decimal number
  - `str()` - Convert to string
- **Interactive Programs**: Programs that respond to user input
- **Input Validation**: Checking if user input is valid
- **String Formatting**: Displaying collected information nicely

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Follow the prompts and enter information when asked

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different types of input
- Make sure to handle potential errors

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and creates an interactive questionnaire that collects and displays user information in a formatted way.
