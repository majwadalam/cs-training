# Assignment 10: Functions - Basics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of functions
- Learn to define and call functions
- Practice using parameters and return values
- Understand variable scope basics

## Topics Covered
- What are functions and why use them?
- Defining functions with def
- Function parameters and arguments
- Return statements
- Local vs global scope (basic introduction)
- Calling functions

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about functions and their basic usage. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 8:** Create a library of utility functions (temperature converter, area calculator, password validator) and a menu system to use them.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how functions work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - Multiple function definitions using `def`
   - Functions with parameters and return values
   - Function calls from a main menu system
   - Proper variable scope usage
   - Input validation within functions
   - Clear function documentation and comments
   - Error handling for invalid inputs

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **Function Definition**: `def function_name(parameters):`
- **Parameters**: Input values passed to functions
- **Arguments**: Actual values passed when calling functions
- **Return Values**: Output from functions using `return`
- **Function Calls**: Using functions by name with arguments
- **Variable Scope**: Local vs global variables
- **Function Documentation**: Using docstrings and comments

## Utility Functions to Create
1. **Temperature Converter**
   - Celsius to Fahrenheit
   - Fahrenheit to Celsius
   - Celsius to Kelvin
   - Kelvin to Celsius

2. **Area Calculator**
   - Rectangle area
   - Circle area
   - Triangle area
   - Square area

3. **Password Validator**
   - Check minimum length
   - Check for uppercase letters
   - Check for numbers
   - Check for special characters
   - Overall strength assessment

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Use the menu to test your utility functions

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your functions with different inputs
- Practice function syntax and calling conventions
- Check that return values are working correctly

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and provides a working utility library with a menu system that demonstrates all your functions working correctly.
