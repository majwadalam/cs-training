# Assignment 6: Loops - For Loops and Range

## Learning Objectives
- Learn for loop syntax and use cases
- Understand the range() function
- Compare for loops vs while loops
- Practice iterating over sequences

## Topics Covered
- For loop syntax
- The range() function (start, stop, step)
- Iterating over numbers and sequences
- When to use for loops vs while loops
- Nested loops introduction

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about for loops and the range() function. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 5:** Create a multiplication table generator that displays tables for numbers 1-12 in a nicely formatted way.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how for loops and range() work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - For loops using the range() function
   - Nested for loops for creating multiplication tables
   - Proper formatting for readable output
   - User input to choose which table(s) to display
   - Range function with different parameters (start, stop, step)
   - Clear headers and organization
   - Comments explaining your loop structure

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **For Loop Syntax**: `for variable in sequence:`
- **Range Function**:
  - `range(stop)` - Numbers from 0 to stop-1
  - `range(start, stop)` - Numbers from start to stop-1
  - `range(start, stop, step)` - Numbers with custom step
- **Nested Loops**: Loops inside other loops
- **Iteration**: Going through each item in a sequence
- **Loop Variables**: Variables that change with each iteration
- **String Formatting**: Making output look professional

## Multiplication Table Requirements
- Display tables for numbers 1-12 (or user choice)
- Show each multiplication from 1 to 12
- Format output in a clear, readable way
- Include headers and proper spacing
- Allow user to choose specific table or all tables
- Use nested for loops efficiently

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Choose which multiplication table(s) to display
5. View the formatted output

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different inputs
- Check your formatting and spacing
- Make sure nested loops work correctly

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and creates nicely formatted multiplication tables using for loops and the range() function.
