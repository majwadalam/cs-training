"""
Assignment: Create a simple grade calculator that takes a numerical score 
and outputs the corresponding letter grade with personalized feedback.

Requirements:
1. Get a numerical score from the user (0-100)
2. Use if, elif, and else statements to determine letter grade
3. Include personalized feedback for each grade level
4. Handle edge cases (scores above 100 or below 0)
5. Use nested conditionals for additional feedback
6. Include logical operators where appropriate
7. Make the output clear and user-friendly
8. Add comments explaining your conditional logic

Grade Scale:
- A: 90-100 (Excellent)
- B: 80-89  (Good)
- C: 70-79  (Average)
- D: 60-69  (Below Average)
- F: 0-59   (Failing)

Example Output:
=== Grade Calculator ===
Enter your numerical score (0-100): 87

=== Grade Report ===
Numerical Score: 87
Letter Grade: B
Performance Level: Good

Detailed Feedback:
✓ You passed the course!
✓ Above average performance
- You're close to an A! Just 3 more points needed.
- Keep up the good work!

Recommendation: Continue your current study habits.
