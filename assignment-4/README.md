# Assignment 4: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand decision-making in programs
- Learn comparison and logical operators
- Write programs that respond differently to different inputs
- Practice program flow control

## Topics Covered
- Boolean expressions and comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- if statements
- elif and else statements
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested if statements

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about conditional statements and decision-making. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 3:** Create a simple grade calculator that takes a numerical score and outputs the corresponding letter grade with personalized feedback.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how conditional statements work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - User input for numerical score
   - if, elif, and else statements
   - Comparison operators (>=, <, etc.)
   - Logical operators (and, or, not) where appropriate
   - Nested conditionals for detailed feedback
   - Clear output with letter grade and personalized message
   - Comments explaining your logic

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Conditional Statements**:
  - `if` - Execute code when condition is true
  - `elif` - Check additional conditions
  - `else` - Execute when all conditions are false
- **Nested Conditionals**: if statements inside other if statements
- **Program Flow Control**: Making decisions based on input

## Grade Scale Reference
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Enter a numerical score when prompted
5. See the letter grade and feedback

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different scores
- Make sure all grade ranges are covered
- Check that your logic handles edge cases

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and correctly converts numerical scores to letter grades with appropriate feedback messages.
