# Example.py - Week 1: Introduction to Programming & Python
# This file demonstrates the basic concepts covered in Week 1

# What is a comment?
# This is a single-line comment. Comments help explain what the code does.
# Python ignores comments when running the program.

"""
This is a multi-line comment (also called a docstring).
You can write longer explanations here.
It's useful for describing what a program does.

# The print() function
# The print() function displays text on the screen
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a simple greeting

# Printing different types of messages
print("Welcome to Programming!")
print("Python is a powerful programming language.")

# You can print multiple things in one print statement
print("My name is", "Python", "and I love to code!")

# Printing empty lines to make output look better
print()  # This prints a blank line

# Examples of different print statements
print("=== Different Ways to Use Print ===")
print("1. Simple text")
print("2. Numbers:", 42)
print("3. Multiple items:", "Age", 20, "Grade", "A")

print()

# More examples with comments
print("=== About Programming ===")
# This explains what programming is
print("Programming is giving instructions to a computer.")
print("Python is beginner-friendly and powerful.")
print("You can create websites, games, and apps with Python!")

print()

# Example of a simple program structure
print("=== My First Program ===")
print("Hello! This is my first Python program.")
print("I am learning to:")
print("- Write clear code")
print("- Use comments effectively")
print("- Display information with print()")

# End of program
print()
print("Program completed successfully!")

# Remember:
# 1. Always use comments to explain your code
# 2. The print() function is your friend for displaying output
# 3. Python reads code from top to bottom
# 4. Practice makes perfect!
