# Assignment 7: Strings and String Methods

## Learning Objectives
- Understand strings as sequences of characters
- Learn string indexing and slicing
- Master common string methods
- Practice string manipulation

## Topics Covered
- String indexing and slicing
- String methods: .upper(), .lower(), .strip(), .replace(), .split()
- String formatting with f-strings
- Checking string properties (.isdigit(), .isalpha(), etc.)
- Strings and loops

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about strings and string manipulation. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 6:** Build a text analyzer that counts words, characters, and performs various text transformations on user input.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how string methods and manipulation work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - String indexing and slicing operations
   - Multiple string methods (.upper(), .lower(), .strip(), .replace(), .split())
   - String property checking (.isdigit(), .isalpha(), etc.)
   - Character and word counting
   - Text transformations and formatting
   - User input handling for text analysis
   - Comments explaining your string operations

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **String Indexing**: Accessing individual characters with `string[index]`
- **String Slicing**: Extracting parts with `string[start:end:step]`
- **String Methods**:
  - `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.title()`, `.capitalize()`
  - `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, `.rstrip()`
  - `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`
  - `.find()`, `.count()`, `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`
- **String Properties**: `.isdigit()`, `.isalpha()`, `.isalnum()`, `.isspace()`
- **String Formatting**: f-strings, `.format()`, string concatenation
- **Strings with Loops**: Iterating through characters

## Text Analyzer Requirements
- Accept text input from user
- Count total characters (including/excluding spaces)
- Count words and sentences
- Display character frequency analysis
- Perform text transformations (uppercase, lowercase, title case)
- Find and replace specific words or characters
- Check for specific patterns or properties
- Display results in a formatted report

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Enter text when prompted and see the analysis results

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different types of text
- Practice string method chaining
- Check string documentation for additional methods

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and creates a comprehensive text analyzer with multiple string operations and clear output formatting.
