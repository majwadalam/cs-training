# Assignment 9: Lists - Advanced Operations and List Comprehensions

## Learning Objectives
- Master advanced list operations
- Understand list comprehensions
- Learn about nested lists
- Practice sorting and searching lists

## Topics Covered
- More list methods: .sort(), .reverse(), .count(), .index()
- List comprehensions (basic introduction)
- Nested lists
- Searching in lists
- Lists vs strings comparison

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about advanced list operations and list comprehensions. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
Create an advanced data management system that processes student information using advanced list operations, list comprehensions, and nested lists.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how advanced list operations work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - Advanced list methods (.sort(), .reverse(), .count(), .index())
   - List comprehensions for filtering and transforming data
   - Nested lists for storing complex data structures
   - Searching and sorting algorithms
   - Data analysis and reporting features
   - Comments explaining your advanced operations

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **Advanced List Methods**:
  - `.sort()`, `.sort(key=function)`, `.sort(reverse=True)`
  - `.reverse()` - Reverse list in place
  - `.count(item)` - Count occurrences
  - `.index(item)` - Find first index of item
- **List Comprehensions**: `[expression for item in list if condition]`
- **Nested Lists**: Lists containing other lists
- **Searching**: Finding specific items or patterns
- **Sorting**: Custom sorting with key functions
- **Data Processing**: Filtering, transforming, and analyzing list data

## Student Management System Requirements
- Store student data in nested lists (name, grades, info)
- Add, remove, and modify student records
- Calculate statistics (averages, highest/lowest grades)
- Sort students by different criteria (name, average grade)
- Search for students by various criteria
- Generate reports using list comprehensions
- Filter data based on conditions
- Display formatted results

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`
4. Use the menu to manage student data with advanced list operations

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Test your program with different data sets
- Practice list comprehension syntax
- Experiment with nested list structures

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and demonstrates advanced list operations, list comprehensions, and complex data management capabilities.
