# Assignment 2: Variables and Data Types

## Learning Objectives
- Understand variables as containers for data
- Learn about different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Practice variable naming conventions
- Perform basic operations with variables

## Topics Covered
- What are variables?
- Naming rules and conventions
- Data types: int, float, str, bool
- Variable assignment and reassignment
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String concatenation

## Files in this Assignment

### 1. example.py
This file contains example code that demonstrates all the concepts we'll cover in class about variables and data types. Study this code carefully and make sure you understand how each part works.

### 2. assignment.py
This is where you'll write your own code to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in the comments within the file.

## Assignment Task
**Assignment 1:** Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations, displaying results with descriptive messages.

## Instructions
1. Open `example.py` first to see how variables and data types work
2. Then open `assignment.py` and follow the instructions
3. Run your program to make sure it works correctly
4. Make sure your code includes:
   - Variables with proper naming conventions
   - At least 3 different data types (int, float, str, bool)
   - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
   - String concatenation
   - Descriptive output messages
   - Comments explaining your code

## Key Concepts to Practice
- **Variable Assignment**: `name = "John"`, `age = 25`
- **Data Types**: 
  - `int` (whole numbers): `42`
  - `float` (decimal numbers): `3.14`
  - `str` (text): `"Hello"`
  - `bool` (True/False): `True`
- **Arithmetic Operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **String Concatenation**: Combining text with `+`
- **Variable Naming**: Use descriptive names, snake_case

## How to Run Your Code
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: `python assignment.py`

## Getting Help
- Review the example.py file if you're stuck
- Ask questions during class
- Check variable naming conventions
- Make sure you're using the right data types

## Submission
Make sure your `assignment.py` file runs without errors and produces a working calculator with descriptive output messages.
