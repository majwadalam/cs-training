Assignment: Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and performs 
basic arithmetic operations, displaying results with descriptive messages.

Requirements:
1. Create variables with proper naming conventions
2. Use at least 3 different data types (int, float, str, bool)
3. Perform all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
4. Use string concatenation or f-strings for descriptive messages
5. Display results in a clear, organized format
6. Include comments explaining your code

Example Output:
=== Simple Calculator ===
Calculator created by: [Your Name]

Numbers for calculation:
First number: 15.5
Second number: 4.2
Data types - First: <class 'float'>, Second: <class 'float'>

Arithmetic Operations:
